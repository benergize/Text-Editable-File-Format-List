# Text-Editable-File-Format-List
A JSON formatted list of file formats editable in text editors as compiled from Notepad++ 'open' list and the top of my head.

I have a strong feeling I've missed a fair few formats and that the example in the repository is grossly inefficient. Feel free to contribute and make this repository better.
